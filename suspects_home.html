                    Biography: Nigel has not had an easy life. He came from a broken home where his father suffered from alcoholism and was inattentive to Nigel as a child – paired with his six other siblings, there simply wasn’t enough love to go around. His misbehaviour at a young age caused him to be excluded from school – which drastically reduced his prospects in later life. 
                    Nigel has a good and true soul at heart but has been unfairly treated in life and his worsening money issues led him to eventual homelessness. 
                    Nigel was seen on CCTV loitering outside a Tesco Express down the road from your house at 9:20pm and was seen wearing black hoodie and cargo trousers.
