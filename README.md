# Milestone Project 2 - Interactive Frontend Application

## Police Suspect Game by Jack Clark

## NOTE: Please load the application and complete the game before reading too much of the development processes as they may spoil/reveal the answers!

### The Premise
##### The premise is similar to that of cluedo.

## Project Goals
#### 1. The primary outcome for this project is to  create fun and challenging game. The different elements have their own specific HTML page for parts such as clues, memories and the roster of suspects to chose from that you can navigate through using the navigation bar and interact with their information to reveal more about the mystery. 
#### 2. The game is essentially that of detective and deduction. There is only one true guilty suspect that commited the crime and you only have one shot at choosing the correct suspect.
#### 3. I have paired the uses of technology with my own personal love and interest in writing particular science fiction and horror to maximise my creative input to this project so it stands out.
